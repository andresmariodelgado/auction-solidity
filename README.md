# ü™ô Auction in Solidity - Auction.sol

## Overview improvements

This project contains a smart contract in Solidity that implements a basic auction, with a defined base bid, fixed duration, partial withdrawal for non-winning bidders while the auction is active, and total withdrawal of all non-winning offers after the auction ends. A persistent history of all bidders is maintained, including the winner and their final bid amount.

## File

- `Auction.sol`: Main contract that handles all auction logic.

## Key Features

‚Ä¢ Automatically starts the auction when deployed (2-day duration, with a base offer of 1 ether).

‚Ä¢ Registers successive bids only if they are at least 5% higher than the current one.

‚Ä¢ Maintains a full bidder history.

‚Ä¢ Refunds accumulated funds (except the final winning offer).

‚Ä¢ Emits events (`NewOffer`, `AuctionEnded`).

## Modifiers and Restrictions

‚Ä¢ `onlyOwner`: Only the owner can execute deposit refunds once the auction ends.

‚Ä¢ `activeAuction`: Ensures the auction is still ongoing.

‚Ä¢ `validprecio`: Validates that a new offer is higher than the current one.

## Key Structures and Variables

‚Ä¢ `Bidders[] offerList`: Bid history with address and amount.

‚Ä¢ `mapping(address => uint256) acummOfers`: Accumulated amount per bidder.

‚Ä¢ `keyList[]`: List of unique keys for iteration.

‚Ä¢ `event NewOffer`: Signals a new offer was made.

‚Ä¢ `event AuctionEnded`: Signals the end of the auction.

## Refunds and Deduction Logic

‚Ä¢ Only the auction owner can refund all non-winning offers (excluding the winner).

‚Ä¢ A 2% fee is deducted and remains in the contract.

‚Ä¢ The winner does not receive a refund for their final offer. If they have unclaimed earlier offers during the auction, they may withdraw them.
